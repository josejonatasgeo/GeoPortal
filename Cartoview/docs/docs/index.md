Cartoview extends the popular GeoNode SDI to provide the ability to create, share, and visualize GIS Web Mapping Applications very easily and very quickly from the browser without programming.

Cartoview enables communities of users to share geospatial applications, to collaborate on these applications, and to exchange the underlying data as Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web services.

Cartoview has been built utilizing open source software and open standards to make it available for all GIS operators and to maximize interoperability.
